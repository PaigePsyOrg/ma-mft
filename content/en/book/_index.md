## Schedule Your Session

I'm pleased you're taking this step toward your wellbeing. Scheduling a session is simple and convenient through my online booking system.

### How to Book

1. Click the "Book Now" button below to access my scheduling calendar
2. Select your preferred date and time from the available slots
3. Fill out the brief intake form
4. You'll receive a confirmation email with details about your appointment

### What to Expect

After booking, you will receive:
- A confirmation email with your appointment details

For new clients, I recommend booking an initial 60-minute session so we have ample time to discuss your concerns and goals.
