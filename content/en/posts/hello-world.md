title: About My Therapy Practice
---

Welcome to my therapy practice! I'm Peiqi Ma, a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Associate specializing in relationship and systemic issues.

Perhaps you've tried various approaches and methods, and maybe not every experience has been ideal. What's wonderful is that you're continuing to seek ways that can help you. I hope I can provide support as well.

I focus on relationship and systemic issues, including family dynamics, work-related challenges, and life transitions. Pregnancy and postpartum mental health is also one of my areas of expertise, including infertility and postpartum depression.

As someone who has lived abroad and now works in the US, immigration-related mental health concerns are also an area I understand deeply, particularly the pressures that professional women may face.

If you have any questions about beginning therapy, I offer a free initial 15-30 minute consultation. Please feel free to contact me anytime. I also offer sliding scale fees - please inquire for more information.
