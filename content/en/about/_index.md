Starting therapy takes courage, and I’m here to meet you with warmth, respect, and curiosity. I work with individuals, children, couples, and families facing a range of challenges—including anxiety, depression, relationship struggles, career burnout, life transitions, and cultural identity concerns. As someone with lived experience as an international student and Asian immigrant, I have a deep understanding of the unique complexities that come with navigating different cultural worlds.I specialize in supporting fellow immigrants, international students, and individuals from Asian backgrounds as they work through intergenerational dynamics, identity exploration, and the search for belonging. 

My approach is relational and collaborative, and utilizes psychodynamic therapy, CBT, trauma-informed, and strength-based work.I help clients explore the roots of their distress while building tools for change and resilience in the present. I believe therapy is a space where you can feel seen, not just for your struggles, but for your strengths, values, and hopes. Wherever you are in your journey, I’d be honored to walk with you.
